# TabZippr Privacy Policy

## Overview
TabZippr is designed with privacy-first principles. We aim to be transparent about what data we access and how we use it.

## Data Collection and Usage

### What We Access
- **Tab Information**: URLs and titles of tabs in your current window (only when you initiate a backup)
- **Window State**: Basic window information for backup/restore functionality
- **Downloads**: Access to download backup files to your device
- **Storage**: For managing backup files locally

### What We Don't Collect or Access
- Browsing history
- Personal information
- Login credentials
- Cookies or tracking data
- Website content
- User location data

### How We Handle Data
- All data remains on your device
- Backups are stored locally as zip files
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No analytics or tracking
- No third-party data sharing

### Permissions Explained
1. `tabs`: Required to read current tab URLs and titles for backup
2. `downloads`: Needed to save backup files to your device
3. `storage`: For managing local extension data
4. `windows`: Required for creating new windows during restore
